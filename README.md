# time-tracker
time tracking app which can be used to track the time spent on tasks

this app is made by Nodejs for the backend along with mongodb database and ReactJs for the frotend

to run this app you need run this command after you clone the project

```
npm install (in the root folder)
cd client
npm install
```

after the dependencies are installed, from the root folder run

```
npm run dev
```

I spend a day working on this project in which I did:

- analysing the problem
- researching the web on how the time trackers work
- defining the model for database
- creating the layout skeleton
- building the backend api
- building the frontend 

I'm a beginner with react so it took me more time than I estimated.

I liked the timer part of the app it is the more important part of the application in my opinion.
I would have added grouping tasks by project if I had more time and user model with autentication
I'm satisfied with Tasks part because I learned new things from the mistakes I made during the development of that component
Lastly, the layout needs to be improved and the Timer and Task components need to be polished because they are bloated and I believe that doesn't conform to react best practices.
